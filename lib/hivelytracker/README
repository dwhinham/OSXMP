This is a fork of the Windows replayer code from HivelyTracker,
available at: https://github.com/pete-gordon/hivelytracker

Modifications:

    * Removed typedefs, replaced with native C99 standard
      integer types and standard booleans.
      This alleviates problems compiling under OS X alongside
      Objective-C++ code.

    * Replaced some occurences of uint32 with size_t for buffer
      lengths. This silences some compiler warnings.
